Operation: Hair Replacement. Input Context: Image 1: The Subject (Selfie). Image 2: The Hairstyle Reference. Primary Instruction: Create a realistic haircut simulation using the reference hairstyle. Execution Guidelines: Replace the hair in Image 1 with the hairstyle in Image 2. Fully remove original hairstyle constraints and transfer the reference haircut structure, including silhouette, fringe/part direction, top volume, side/fade gradation, and parting. You may alter the hairline to fit the target style. Strict Constraints: IDENTITY: Keep the face, skin tone, body, and clothing of Image 1 exactly unchanged. ENVIRONMENT: Keep the background, camera angle, and lighting of Image 1 exactly unchanged. HAIR COLOR: Keep scalp hair color natural. BEARD: Keep beard shape and color unchanged (unless sideburns need to be blended into the new haircut). OUTPUT: Return a single, high-fidelity portrait image.
