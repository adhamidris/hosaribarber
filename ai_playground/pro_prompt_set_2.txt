Operation: Hair Replacement. Input Context: Image 1: The Subject (Selfie). Image 2: The Hairstyle Reference. Primary Instruction: Create a realistic haircut simulation using the reference hairstyle. Execution Guidelines: 1. REPLACE: Completely remove the subject's original hairstyle. Do not let the original hair volume or shape limit the new style. 2. MATCH: Visibly transfer the structure of the reference hairstyle to the subject. You must match the reference silhouette, fringe direction, top volume, side/fade gradation, and parting. 3. ADAPT: You may alter the subject hairline to fit the new style. Prioritize the reference style over the original hairline shape. Strict Constraints: IDENTITY: Keep the face, skin tone, body, and clothing of Image 1 exactly unchanged. ENVIRONMENT: Keep the background, camera angle, and lighting of Image 1 exactly unchanged. HAIR COLOR: Keep scalp hair color natural. BEARD: Keep beard shape and color unchanged (unless sideburns need to be blended into the new haircut). OUTPUT: Return a single, high-fidelity portrait image.
