Operation: Hair Replacement. Input Context: Image 1: The Subject (Selfie). Image 2: The Hairstyle Reference. Primary Instruction: Create a realistic haircut simulation using the reference hairstyle. Execution Guidelines: Stage 1 erase original scalp hair influence. Stage 2 apply the reference haircut faithfully. Stage 3 verify the output is visibly different from the input haircut while identity and scene remain unchanged. Strict Constraints: IDENTITY: Keep the face, skin tone, body, and clothing of Image 1 exactly unchanged. ENVIRONMENT: Keep the background, camera angle, and lighting of Image 1 exactly unchanged. HAIR COLOR: Keep scalp hair color natural. BEARD: Keep beard shape and color unchanged (unless sideburns need to be blended into the new haircut). OUTPUT: Return a single, high-fidelity portrait image.
