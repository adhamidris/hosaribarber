Input: Image 1 is selfie and Image 2 is hairstyle reference. Change only the scalp hair in Image 1. Replace the hairstyle in Image 1 with the hairstyle from Image 2. Reference haircut is the source of truth. Do not keep the original haircut shape. Match the reference overall silhouette, total length, top volume, fringe/part direction, and side/fade shape. You may fully adapt the hairline to fit the reference style. Keep face, skin tone, body, and clothing unchanged. Keep background, camera angle, and lighting unchanged. Keep scalp hair color natural. Keep beard shape and color unchanged, except needed sideburn blending. Return one realistic portrait image only.
