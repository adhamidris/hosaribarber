Input: Image 1 is selfie, Image 2 is hairstyle reference, and Image 3 is beard reference. Use Image 2 as the haircut target for Image 1. Fully replace the current hairstyle in Image 1. Do not preserve the original hair shape or volume. Match the reference hairstyle clearly: silhouette, fringe/part direction, top volume, and side/fade shape. You may adapt the hairline if needed so the reference style fits correctly. Keep face, skin tone, body, and clothing unchanged. Keep background, camera angle, and lighting unchanged. Keep scalp hair color natural. Use Image 3 as beard reference and blend sideburns naturally into the haircut. Set beard color to Dark Brown. Return one realistic portrait image only.
