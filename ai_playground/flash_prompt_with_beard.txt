Apply the hairstyle reference to the selfie person. The haircut must visibly match the reference; do not keep the original hairstyle. Match haircut structure: overall silhouette, fringe/part direction, top length and volume, and side/fade shape. If exact matching is hard, prioritize changing the hairstyle toward the reference over leaving it unchanged. Keep identity and scene unchanged: face, skin tone, body, clothing, background, camera angle, and lighting. Keep natural hairline unchanged. Never invent a new hairline. Edit only requested hair and beard regions. No extra edits or beauty filters. Keep scalp hair color natural. Also apply beard shape and density from the beard reference image. Keep beard color natural. You are given three images: selfie, hairstyle reference, beard reference. Return one final single portrait image only.
