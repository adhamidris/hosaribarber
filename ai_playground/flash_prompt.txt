Apply the hairstyle reference to the selfie person. The haircut must visibly match the reference; do not keep the original hairstyle. Match haircut structure: overall silhouette, fringe/part direction, top length and volume, and side/fade shape. If exact matching is hard, prioritize changing the hairstyle toward the reference over leaving it unchanged. Keep identity and scene unchanged: face, skin tone, body, clothing, background, camera angle, and lighting. Keep natural hairline unchanged. Never invent a new hairline. Edit only requested hair and beard regions. No extra edits or beauty filters. Keep scalp hair color natural. Keep beard shape unchanged. Keep beard color natural. You are given two images: selfie and hairstyle reference. Return one final single portrait image only.
