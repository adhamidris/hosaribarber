Input: Image 1 is selfie and Image 2 is hairstyle reference. Task: replace hairstyle in Image 1 using Image 2 as the only haircut target. Hard edit: completely remove the current scalp hair in Image 1 before applying the new style. Do not preserve old hair shape, length, or volume. Haircut match must be obvious: same silhouette, same fringe or part direction, same top mass, and same side/fade flow. If the result looks unchanged, regenerate with stronger replacement. You may modify hairline placement to fit the target style. Keep face, skin tone, body, and clothing unchanged. Keep background, camera angle, and lighting unchanged. Keep scalp hair color natural. Keep beard shape and color unchanged, except needed sideburn blending. Return one realistic portrait image only.
