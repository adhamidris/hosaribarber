Input: Image 1 is selfie and Image 2 is hairstyle reference. Two-step edit: first remove existing scalp hair, then apply the hairstyle from Image 2. The final haircut should read as the reference style on the same person, not a light variation of the old cut. Match outline, layers, top lift, fringe/part, and fade gradient from the reference. Force a visible style change while preserving photorealism. Keep face, skin tone, body, and clothing unchanged. Keep background, camera angle, and lighting unchanged. Keep scalp hair color natural. Keep beard shape and color unchanged, except needed sideburn blending. Return one realistic portrait image only.
