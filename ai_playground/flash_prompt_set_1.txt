Input: Image 1 is selfie and Image 2 is hairstyle reference. Use Image 2 as the haircut target for Image 1. Fully replace the current hairstyle in Image 1. Do not preserve the original hair shape or volume. Match the reference hairstyle clearly: silhouette, fringe/part direction, top volume, and side/fade shape. You may adapt the hairline if needed so the reference style fits correctly. Keep face, skin tone, body, and clothing unchanged. Keep background, camera angle, and lighting unchanged. Keep scalp hair color natural. Keep beard shape and color unchanged, except needed sideburn blending. Return one realistic portrait image only.
