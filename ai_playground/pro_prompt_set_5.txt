Operation: Hair Replacement. Input Context: Image 1: The Subject (Selfie). Image 2: The Hairstyle Reference. Primary Instruction: Create a realistic haircut simulation using the reference hairstyle. Execution Guidelines: Edit scalp hair only. Replace the hairstyle in Image 1 with Image 2 and treat the reference as the source of truth. Match silhouette, total length, top volume, fringe/part direction, and side/fade shape. You may fully adapt hairline placement to fit the reference. Strict Constraints: IDENTITY: Keep the face, skin tone, body, and clothing of Image 1 exactly unchanged. ENVIRONMENT: Keep the background, camera angle, and lighting of Image 1 exactly unchanged. HAIR COLOR: Keep scalp hair color natural. BEARD: Keep beard shape and color unchanged (unless sideburns need to be blended into the new haircut). OUTPUT: Return a single, high-fidelity portrait image.
